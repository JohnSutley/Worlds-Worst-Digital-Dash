This folder contains the project files for the Worlds Worst Digital Dash
(Gameboy Digital Dash) project. If attempting to recreate version 1 of the
Arduino CANBUS card, please make a note of the included "Project Note" and 
"Project Note 2" pictures in the "Arduino Canbus Card" project folder, since 
I totally messed up the DB9 connector pinout and missed a trace leading to 
the 7805 voltage regulator. Also, I had to bridge some connections on top of 
the Arduino. Gotta admit, not my best work. The "reader.gb" file in the 
Gameboy Code folder is the pre-compiled binary that gets flashed to the EEPROM. 
The software used in this project is as follows:

-Kicad 7.0

-Autodesk Fusion 2.0.20494 x86_64

-Arduino IDE Version: 2.3.4

-GBDK-2020

-Savvy CAN V208

-Xgpro v12.66

-UltiMaker Cura 5.6.0

-LightBurn 1.6.03

-GIMP 2.10.36

-Visual Studio Code Version: 1.96.2

I think LightBurn was the only paid software I used, and that was for the
laser engraver.
